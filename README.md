# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

Java follows four main OOP principles:

1. **Encapsulation** - Hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary parts.
2. **Inheritance** - Allowing one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another.
3. **Polymorphism** - Allowing methods to have multiple implementations (method overloading and overriding).
4. **Abstraction** - Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.
